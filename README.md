# PlayerTroll

My second plugin. For 1.20.4. Made on 2/21/2024.

Adds some trolling methods for players. Created to torment Sharky54.

Use the `/pt` command to toggle trolls for specific players. (aliases: `/playertroll`, `/josh`)

Trolls:
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| crouch_hiss | Any time another player un-crouches, the creeper hiss is played nearby. |
| ghost_blocks | Player breaks the block but CANT lol. |
| vanish | Player vanishes from the server. Where did he go!? |
